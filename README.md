## WatchCartoonOnline Kodi Addon

Since Spoyser removed his kodi repository, I removed his fork as well. I just kept the watchcartoononline kodi plugin and might occassionally improve it.

The last version was 1.0.22 with the following changes:
- simplified displaying of seasons and episodes
- added watched status (cartoon only considered watch if played to end)
- watched status can also be set via context menu

Also the plugin version here fixes some bugs and keeps all series images it encounters.

**Changes**
- v1.0.24, working as of 19. Nov 2016
  - image tags changed, images were removed from episodes
